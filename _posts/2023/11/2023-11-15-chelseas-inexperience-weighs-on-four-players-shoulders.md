You can feel the weight of inexperience on the shoulders of the experienced Thiago Silva, Raheem Sterling, Reece James, and Conor Gallagher when you watch Chelsea. They look like a group of kids because they are. That is a lot of weight. 

<!---more--->

A weight you can feel when you watch those first 20 minutes against Tottenham. 

It's not age, it's time spent in a first team, in a top team. You can be young with experience like Cole Palmer. You watch Palmer and you can tell he has played for a team that won the treble.

You don't get a sense that there's one leader. One pillar. 

No one is on the same wavelength. It is a group of young individuals all trying to get their timing down.
