May 28, 2023 â€” Pass into Romelu Lukaku with his back to the goal, hold up play, lay off a simple pass, and play someone into space. This efficient and assertive pattern of play sets Inter apart.

If Romelu Lukaku is Batman, Lautaro Martinez is Robin, right there when he needs assistance. They have this move down pat. Martinez will wrap around to the front to always give Lukaku an immediate out.

Lautaro again curves his run to meet Lukaku. Lukaku's hold-up play is almost unstoppable; he does such a good job shielding the ball by planting his body down like a tree. 

Martinez shows off his passing ability in this play in Figure 2.4, and it's lethal. Batman and Robin are clicking. 

Notice how efficient it is. Four passes and they are in.

Inter is so confident in this move; they have center-back Francesco Acerbi furthest forward, ready to receive the pass from Marcelo Brozovic and lead the attack. 

Fearlessness and efficiency are a dangerous combination. Their structure allows it and they're not afraid to take advantage of deficiencies in Atalanta's defense.

And if someone isn't available to pass to, Romelu Lukaku has the awareness to dribble out of trouble and then pick out the pass down the middle. 

The key to Inter's success is the middle of the pitch. They can control the middle like no other team.
