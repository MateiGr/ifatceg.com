May 18, 2023 — Rodri, for Manchester City against Real Madrid, shows why he is one of the world's best defensive midfielders with his ability to see the entire field and pick the right pass.

Most midfielders would have forced that pass to Kevin De Bruyne, but Rodri has the foresight to know that Toni Kroos can easily intercept the ball.

Rodri remains patient.

Rodri’s patience is awarded. Out of the three options available, he picks the correct one, and now Manchester City is threatening, in transition, at speed.

These are things that go unnoticed. Good defensive midfielders are boring, but if you watch Rodri closely, nothing is boring. He can see the entire pitch with his eyes closed. 

This makes you appreciate the buildup to Manchester City’s first goal even more.

Again, reading the play. Anticipating when defenders will move and ignoring “open” players. By the time they’re not open, Rodri is already making the next pass.

I mentioned during the [Bayern Munich match last week](https://tacticsjournal.com/Low-Viscosity-Bayern-Munich/) that I love when players pass and immediately move because it opens up so much space. Bernardo Silva demonstrates the space this movement can create. 

Don't think, pass and move.

The combined intelligence of both John Stones and Bernardo Silva could power a supercomputer. They know when to go, they know when to stay, and they do it without thinking.

This goal would not be possible without the awareness of Rodri to pick out the correct pass, the perfect pass. And this is just two examples. There are dozens of other examples during a match where he pulls the correct strings.

The silent conductor.
