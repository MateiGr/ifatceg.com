According to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/28/premier-league-referees-to-add-on-time-lost-for-goal-celebrations-this-season), in an attempt to "stop time wasting", Premier League matches will now have more extra time similar to that used in the World Cup. 8-10 minutes added on was not good for the viewers or players. The balance was perfect with an in play average of 54mins 49secs last season.
