I'm growing increasingly frustrated with Jack Grealish's unwillingness to attempt to beat his man to the corner. Every attempt for club and country is a cut infield, either to draw a foul or pass back. The only way they can progress through the left-hand side is if James Maddison makes a run beyond Grealish.

This forces England to play exclusively through the middle of the pitch, to start and end possessions, which leads to fewer chances because generating chances exclusively through the middle is difficult without an outlet wide to attack the corner.

Most wingers would take a touch to the left and immediately run at the opposition full-back, then either dribble around them or play Maddison in. Jack Grealish's default is to play back, the safe pass to circulate.

Once Grealish passes back, they should look to immediately play the ball back to him because he often finds himself in positive positions in the half-space.

Jack Grealish is fantastic in the tackle. He's very strong and knows how to time a hip or time a leg so he can win 50-50s like this one.

Until Jack Grealish works up the confidence to attempt some progressive carries to the corner, a runner from the half-space to the space out wide is the only way England and Manchester City will be able to progress the ball and create chances on the left side.

The fewer touches Grealish takes, the better.
