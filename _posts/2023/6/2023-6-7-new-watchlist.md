June 7, 2023 â€” I have decided to create a public watchlist of players whom I think are undervalued, separated by position and age, with links to both their FBref page and a YouTube compilation.

Making this XI is so hard because there are no wrong choices from the watchlist. They all should be playing at a higher level.

Finding gems is hard nowadays, and prices for players are skyrocketing. It's unsustainable. Finding gems before they become overvalued by the market is satisfying.

Thinking of the possibilities, envisioning where players can play out of their current positions should not be something that is frowned upon.

Declan Rice at left center-back, Devyn Rensch at right center-back, and Jadon Sancho at left center-midfield as an 8. It's so bold, so brave of me to suggest. Maybe in months or even years, we can look back and say I was right because I really want to see these players reach their full potential.

It all depends on the system they play in. 

I will be updating this watchlist whenever I find a new player to add. It's never a complete list. I'm constantly looking for new additions. I'll post updates on Twitter [@TacticsJournal](https://twitter.com/tacticsjournal) when I add someone new.

You'll know if I add them because I won't stop talking about them.
