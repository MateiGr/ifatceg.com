April 23, 2023 — Brighton’s normal buildup was nullified by Manchester United’s tight man-to-man marking in the FA Cup semi-final match, similar to [how United stopped Manchester City](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023-1-20-Man-City-2-3-with-inverted-lb-or-rb-leaves-them-too-vulnerable/).

In the first half, Brighton built up in a 4-2 sub-structure, and Manchester United man-marked throughout the pitch, except for **Anthony Martial** whose job was to press both **Lewis Dunk and Adam Webster**. 

This created no room for their supporting creators **Caicedo, Mac Allister, and Enciso**, which made the lives of their transition players **Mitoma, March, and Welbeck** very hard. The transition players are reliant on those supporting players to progress the ball into the final third, so if you remove that outlet, then it’s hard to create numerical advantages in transition. 

It played perfectly into Manchester United’s hands, and they always had the numbers back to match **Mitoma, March, Enciso, and Welbeck** 4v4 with **Casemiro** as the plus one.

Robert De Zerbi countered this by having **Estupinan and Gross invert** in the second half, and Brighton switched to a 2-3 sub-structure. 

Estupinan inverting allowed **Mitoma**, who had a difficult job separating from Aaron Wan-Bissaka, more space on the left wing. This change also allowed **Mac Allister** to push forward, disrupting the pressing assignments of Manchester United’s first line.

The most interesting Brighton player was **Pervis Estupinan**. In the first half, he unlocked Manchester United’s with his runs inside into the right half-space to help the team transition out of the buildup. 

The negative to this run was that it left space open for Antony on the right wing, for which Manchester United attacked unsuccessfully on two or three counterattacks.

Estupinan did the same in the second half, but now that Brighton we're more compact, **the threat of Antony on the right wing was limited**.

This move by **Estupinan paired with Welbeck dropping** began to cause Manchester United problems.

Manchester United’s rest defense always outnumbered Brighton’s attackers, but with moves like this, Brighton could gain numerical superiority on the break once they got past United’s initial press. 

Ultimately, Brighton lost on penalties, and Manchester United advanced to face Manchester City in the FA Cup Final. United should look to copy this man-to-man marking scheme in the final, but they’ll need to remain as relentless defensively as they did in the second half to have a chance at beating Manchester City.
