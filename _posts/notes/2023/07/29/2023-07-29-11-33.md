Another clinical U21 forward to add to the collection at Chelsea is Elye Wahi, if they sign him. He may not be as well-rounded in passing, heading, tackling, and is shorter compared to Nicolas Jackson, but he is a proficient dribbler who can provide goals from LW or CF. ![](https://i.imgur.com/eRGEpkr.jpg)
