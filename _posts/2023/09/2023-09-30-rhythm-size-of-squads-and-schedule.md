September 30, 2023 — Pep Guardiola, when asked if he needs a bigger squad to cope with the number of games and the short time between them, stated, "[If] I can't handle managing games with just 11-14 players for a long time, I don't want to be a manager."

<!---more--->

> "It's not sustainable for the clubs. Yeah, people say you have 90, 80, 90 players, or 20, and then after a year, six injuries. Uh — you should have a larger squad, but what happens after that when you have an injured player, someone says, 'You have 25 players'. [If] I can't handle managing games with just 11-14 players for a long time, I don't want to be a manager. If I suffer, who knows, I prefer that situation. It's a risk, it's okay. It is more sustainable for the clubs because every new player is a transfer, he's on a salary, and whatever.
>  
> That's why your squad has to be versatile. This player can play in three or four positions, Bernardo can play two or three, Phil can play two, three, or four positions, Julian can also play different positions, Oscar Bobb, for example, can play three positions, so you don't need extras."

This is the versatility that Manchester City and many other top teams have. Players who can play in multiple positions. Not quantity, but players who can play two, three, or more positions. A team that can shift and change without warning. This is the most unpredictable Manchester City team in recent history, more so than last season, but they lost experience in Ilkay Gündoğan.

> "People say 'I want two players for each position.' I don't agree with that. I don't agree because in the end, to be effective, you have to have a regular 11 and make two or three substitutions. When you rotate six or seven players every week, it doesn't work well because the mechanisms, they accept there are a lot of games, and they get exhausted. But I don't think it's going to happen."

Pep is referring to the traditional old-school philosophy that many teams employ. Two examples are Arsenal and Newcastle.

Mikel Arteta stated, "We wanted to build a squad with two quality players in each position, with different characteristics, and we have got that now. And to maximize that, they have to play games, and we have a lot of things coming up now."

Eddie Howe said his Newcastle side had the "perfect depth" with two players fit to play each position.

They have the depth, now how will they use it? Will they stick to just one or two changes or will they change their goalkeeper every match, like Mikel Arteta has hinted he might do with Aaron Ramsdale and David Raya? 

> "If I won fewer games, I would manage another team. If they want me not to play in European competitions, and after that, there would be long weeks, so that's for sure. But when you're playing top teams and you are lucky to play in European competitions; when that happens, then I'll have to accept it. I put it on the table, but I'm saying that I know it's not going to be changed, so I accept it.
> 
> I've done it in my career, 12 or 30 years being a manager, even when I was a football player in Barcelona, and I believed that all the time. It's just now the rhythm is more, the rest between games is less, and you know that is the only big difference, but always I lived it and it was quite well, honestly."

Two to three changes max and maintain rhythm. Manchester City can be unpredictable because of the versatility in the squad, with players changing position to rest other players, but no wholesale changes every match.

Manchester City is the Premier League team that is best prepared for this upcoming stretch of matches with 2-3 days rest in between. They have years of experience managing this schedule. It won't affect them as much; this is just another year.

The rest of the teams will be either heavily injured like Manchester United, learning as they go like Arsenal and Newcastle, or both injured and learning.
