If it were up to me, this is the starting eleven I would pick for both Liverpool and Manchester United in their match on Sunday, March 5, 2023. Please note that while this lineup is not a prediction, my expectations for how the teams will react and perform in this configuration are.

Since this is a derby at Anfield, when Man United is in possession, you would expect Liverpool to press relentlessly. However, there is a chance they will choose to sit in a mid block and allow Man United to advance into their own half, defending in a narrow 4-4-2 out of possession.

Man United should look to take advantage of Liverpool's narrowness by overloading either wing, specifically the left-wing. That's why I would like to see Jadon Sancho at left-wing because as of late, the overloads that both Sancho and Marcus Rashford (CF) have created have caused other teams problems when both were on the pitch. Luke Shaw and Fred will both help in that overload, with Shaw being the safe pass out as the free man on the touch-line.

Bruno Fernandes would shift forward into the space that Rashford occupied, and Antony at right-wing would lurk behind left-back Andrew Robertson.

Man United did something similar for their first goal in their last encounter with Liverpool in August. They overloaded the left-wing to create a 6v5, forcing Liverpool to commit numbers to one side of the pitch.

Anthony Elanga (LW) and Christian Eriksen (CM) played a one-two out of the 6v5, setting Elanga off into the corner.

Marcus Rashford (CF) and Jadon Sancho (RW) were loosely marked 2v2, centrally, inside the box. Elanga found Sancho for the goal.

I'll get to this when I talk about Man United's out-of-possession shape, but I would assume that Fred will likely operate in the left half-space, aiding in the overload on the left-wing and staying further forward to get onto the end of balls on the edge of the box.

Man United should overload the left-wing, which then opens up two options.

 - Switch the play to the right-wing to isolate Anthony Robertson (RB) 1v1 and put crosses into the box from Diego Dalot (RB) or Antony (RW).
 - Work the ball into the corner out of the overload, so they can drive at goal or play a ball centrally, inside the box.

If Liverpool can press Man United man-to-man high and hard, they'll have a more difficult time advancing the ball into the Liverpool's half. Liverpool tend to play better when they're not reactionary and force the other team back into their own defensive end, especially against a team like Man United who like fashioning chances from passes from their back-line. It will be a game won out wide because that will be the path of least resistance for Man United if Liverpool setup narrow with minimal pressing. If Liverpool sit back they'll need to keep the pressure on Man United's wingers.

When counter-pressing, Liverpool should look to press high to pin Man United back into their own defensive end and force them to play the ball directly in the air, rather than on the ground, to quickly win back the ball.

When Liverpool is in possession, I'd expect them to be pressed aggressively by Man United, not allowing them any time or space on the ball. Fernandes will look to curve his run and be the head of the press when center-backs Virgil van Dijk or Joel Matip have the ball. Fred is a key figure for Man United because he will, as Erik Ten Hag likes to say, be playing the part of a “mosquito.”

> Erik Ten Hag on Fred vs. Barcelona on February 23rd: "His role was to stop Frenkie de Jong and be like a mosquito all over him."

Fred is used to shadow the other team's most important transition playmaker, in either half-space because he's reliable in the tackle. He did the same with De Bruyne versus Man City and Longstaff versus Newcastle, or Joelinton when Longstaff was subbed out. Fred will look to disrupt Henderson’s ability to play the ball into the triangle on the right-wing, between Henderson, Mohamed Salah (RW), and Trent Alexander-Arnold (RB).

The front four of Man United's press should cause Liverpool problems advancing the ball into the wide areas. They will try to force Van Dijk (CB) and Matip (CB) into mistakes to spring counterattacks.

Darwin Nunez (LW), or whoever plays at left-wing since there is a chance Nunez is injured, will likely invert to allow more room for Robertson (LB) on the left-wing by dragging Dalot (RB) infield. This is where Antony’s (RW) ability to cover larger areas in defense comes into play. He excels at pressing, taking pressure off the other midfielders and Dalot. His presence should help disrupt Robertson on the left-wing.

If Sancho (LW) gets caught further out wide marking Alexander-Arnold, Matip should look to advance the ball into the open space on the right-wing to help overload Man United 4v3. Matip has been known to do this in the past to great effect.

Liverpool should be counter-pressed high by Man United with forwards Fernandes and Rashford curving their runs, with Antony and Sancho man-to-man out wide. Fred will be tight to Henderson, as he is the most important player for Liverpool in transition, but he should get further forward to mark whoever sits in front of the backline. In this case, defensive-midfielder Keita.

I would give Man United the edge over Liverpool in the match if what I outlined comes true. They will have the numerical superiority on the far-side of play and are superior pressing when in defense. I’d expect it to be a loud and frantic fast-paced match.
