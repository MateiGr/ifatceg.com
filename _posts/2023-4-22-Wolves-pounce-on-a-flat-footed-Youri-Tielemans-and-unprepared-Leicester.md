April 22, 2023 — This has not been a good week for those passing forward to flat-footed defenders or midfielders facing goal.

First, we had [David De Gea to Harry Maguire for Manchester United](https://tacticsjournal.com/David-De-Gea-risky-pass-to-Maguire-facing-goal-costs-Manchester-United/) on Thursday, then [Aaron Ramsdale to Zinchenko for Arsenal](https://tacticsjournal.com/Aaron-Ramsdale-channels-his-inner-David-De-Gea/) on Friday, and Wout Faes to Youri Tielemans for Leicester today.

Youri Tielemans is flat-footed receiving this ball and not prepared for the challenge of Mario Lemina behind him. Each Leicester player is fixed in their posture, ball-watching, and flat. Unprepared to advance the ball and walk into position. 

Wolves are the opposite, moving and chasing the ball.

Mario Lemina’s defensive instincts in this play are top realizing the weakness and pouncing to regain possession.

Leicester is unprepared and in trouble, facing four Wolves forwards versus their three defenders. Victor Kristiansen is off in the corner watching. The back-line was disjointed and caught off guard. 

Matheus Cunha tucks it away from the top of the penalty area for the goal.
