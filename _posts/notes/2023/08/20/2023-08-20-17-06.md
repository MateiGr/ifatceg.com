Thoughts go out to Olga Carmona who scored the game winning goal for Spain today against England to win the World Cup. She sadly lost her father and [was told the news after the match](https://x.com/rfef/status/1693350809424031985?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g). Incredibly tragic but he would be proud.
