I miss having matches without VAR for offsides or penalties. [Semi-automated offside technology](https://www.fifa.com/technical/football-technology/football-technologies-and-innovations-at-the-fifa-world-cup-2022/semi-automated-offside-technology) is the only way forward. I noticed this watching a basketball highlight; Kevin Durant clearly stepped out of bounds, but play went on. No check, no waiting, continued entertainment.
