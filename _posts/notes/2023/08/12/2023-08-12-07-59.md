I prefer [Declan Rice outside of Jurrien Timber in possession](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/08/03/declan-rice-outside-of-jurrien-timber-for-arsenal/), which is why I think it would be better that Timber plays at LCM. The transition from LCM to LB out of possession is less awkward than LCM to LCB for Declan Rice.
