[Wataru Endo's former coach Cho Kwi-Jae](https://www.jfa.jp/eng/samuraiblue/news/00030751/): "Reminiscent of Fabio Cannavaro, I thought his game intuition would translate well in Europe. [...] There are players who are converted from attacking positions to defensive positions, but he is the opposite. He is a unique type of player."
