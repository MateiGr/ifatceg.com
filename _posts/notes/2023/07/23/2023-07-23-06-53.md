Manuel Akanji defending on the left [has never worked](https://tacticsjournal.com/The-flaws-of-Manuel-Akanji-Kyle-Walker-that-cost-Manchester-City-against-Real-Madrid/). Looses his man and lunging to tackles with his weak foot, not good. He's slow to launch of his right foot when rotating 180 degrees, much faster rotating off his left heel. Angles are still bad.
