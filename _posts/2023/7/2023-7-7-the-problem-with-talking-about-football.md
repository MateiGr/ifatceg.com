This quote from this video has stuck with me.

It is hard to convey what is happening in a football match without visuals. This is why I use them. 

English is not everyone's first language. Only 19% of the world's population speaks English, [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266808/the-most-spoken-languages-worldwide/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20there%20were%20around,at%20the%20time%20of%20survey). 

I can't imagine what it would be like to try to learn and absorb written, audio, or video content about the complexities of football without examples. 

It's okay to think complicated; everyone does because this is a very complicated game. But football should be conveyed in the simplest terms possible so that everyone can understand and quickly pick up on the unnoticed things.
