July 3, 2023 — To start next season off right, I'm doing a little housekeeping. Here is what I have planned for the season.

The [latest issues with Twitter](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781198/twitter-daily-reading-limit-elon-musk-verified-paywall) have aligned my thinking. This blog will be my main focus above all other mediums. 

I will be posting once a day, every day, to this blog. No character limit, no rate limits, no restrictions, and forever free to read. All attention and effort will go here. 

I'll be covering anything that's tactically interesting to me. In particular, I'm looking forward to the Women's World Cup! 

This was a nice short off-season break, but I'll be getting back to that the daily schedule I was on when the pre-season matches begin.

[Join 740+ other people in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pdnPS3u5hW) dedicated to discussing football tactics. Tactics Discord! 

We not only have a thriving community of coaches and creators, but several ways for you to stay up-to-date on all of the football news, taken from Twitter and elsewhere, without leaving our server: 

- News channels, so you can stay up-to-date with all the latest club and transfer news. 
- Data channels, to get data graphics before and after matches, separated by league. 

For writers and creators, you can promote your content: 

- Your tweets will be automatically sent to chat. Conversation starters. 
- In our blog channel, you can share your longer form posts. 
- In our video channel, you can share your videos.  

We have a ton of thought-provoking conversations all day, and it's a lot of fun. Outside of Twitter, I haven't had such great interactions. It's not the normal experience you'd expect in a chatroom. There is tons of substance. 

It's a great way to learn if you're new because everyone is willing to help answer your questions. 

I'd highly recommend you join. An updated invite link will always be included in the footer of the blog.
