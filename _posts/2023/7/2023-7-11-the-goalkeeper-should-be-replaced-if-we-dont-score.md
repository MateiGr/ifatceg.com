July 11, 2023 — There is a strange phenomenon where people overlook or cast too much of a spotlight on a goalkeeper based on the amount of goals their team scores. Not concede, score. 

<!---more--->

Sounds strange but it's true sadly. The perfect example is André Onana versus Kepa Arrizabalaga. Here is a basic comparison to prove my point. 

Inter Milan scored 71 goals last season, and Chelsea scored 38 goals.

Kepa was the better shot-stopper statistically last season, with a PSxG+/- of 0.18 per 90. They both had a nearly identical save percentage yet Kepa faced 0.75 more shots per 90.  Onana has the upper hand in the cross stopping department though, stopping 0.5% more crosses attempted.

If Onana played for Chelsea last season, would you be happy if your club paid €55m for him? I don't think a club would pay that amount for Kepa right now, but if you put him on Inter Milan than maybe they would. 

Should Onana start for Inter Milan next season or should they rush to replace him? That's the question many Chelsea fans are asking of Kepa; they want him replaced. 

The scapegoat for poor attacking returns is the defense, and whether they're performing well or not, the first person to be blamed is the goalkeeper. Both made errors, but Andre Onana and Kepa Arrizabalaga performed like world-class goalkeepers last season. 

Why did Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter, Bruno Saltor, Frank Lampard, and now Mauricio Pochettino all say 'Kepa is still Chelsea's number one goalkeeper'? Because he's been performing well. There was and is no reason to replace someone that's performing at that high a level. 

If you want to go to an extreme, look at Ederson for Manchester City. He had a career worst 62.3% save percentage from only 2.20 shots per 90, with a -4.8 PSxG+/-. But they scored 94 goals so no one cares. 

I reckon Manchester City would have wrapped up the Premier League three weeks sooner if they had a better performing goalkeeper who is a comparable passer, allowing them to rest their players for the final matches of the season. 

A defense made up of Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Aké, Manuel Akanji, and Kyle Walker should set records, not concede 39 goals. 

I'm not saying Ederson is a bad goalkeeper, he's in the S tier, but he has been in a bad period. I'm using this as an example to highlight the hypocrisy of goalkeeping analysis within the public. It's illogical to judge a goalkeeper's performance based on the offensive output of a team. 

Goalkeepers are built on form. You need to have a short-term memory when evaluating them or you'll get stuck behind the curve. All three will dip and peak at different times. 

I'd like to see what the reaction will be if Andre Onana performs the same as he did at Inter, but United score close to or fewer goals than last season, 58. Will they shine the spotlight brighter on him or will they be able to ignore the errors?
