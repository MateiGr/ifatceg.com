May 20, 2023 — Pep Guardiola made a subtle but effective change to improve Manchester City's fluidity against Real Madrid. Ruben Dias moves back to open up space, and either Rodri or John Stones must be parallel to Manuel Akanji at left-back.

The solution implemented in the second leg was simple: 

1. Always have someone close and parallel to Manuel Akanji, either Rodri or John Stones.
2. Ruben Dias must move back when Manuel Akanji receives the ball to create space for the pass to the player parallel to Akanji.

Rodri parallel and Ruben Dias pushed back. Both open themselves up for the pass in pockets of space.

In order to shorten the distance between Manuel Akanji and John Stones, Akanji inverts. 

Shorter distances allowed for quicker connections and progress into Real Madrid's end.

Smaller distances, easier to quickly connect short passes, to pass out and progress into Real Madrid’s half.

Real Madrid were not prepared structurally to pressure Manchester City but if you compare and contrast this with what we saw [when City faced Fulham](https://tacticsjournal.com/Manuel-Akanji-weak-foot-and-bad-angles-at-left-center-back-in-Manchester-City-3-2), it’s night and day. 

There was more than one option out when Manuel Akanji received the ball.

Manuel Akanji now had more options to connect play: the lateral pass to Rodri or Stones, and the back pass to Ruben Dias. Two options. 

Manuel Akanji inverting opens the pass out to Jack Grealish on the wing. A third option. 

If Manchester City could manipulate Real Madrid's press by staggering players, it would open up space for Kyle Walker to be free on the far side. A fourth option. 

More options, less problems.

When a player wasn't parallel, Ruben Dias would quickly move back to draw defenders away from the open space, preventing the lateral pass or switch from being blocked.

Pass and move. Ruben Dias played the most crucial role, and it was an easy role. Pass to Manuel Akanji, move back to open the room.

After the first leg, Pep Guardiola mentioned that Manchester City [needed to improve their fluidity](https://tacticsjournal.com/The-flaws-of-Manuel-Akanji-Kyle-Walker-that-cost-Manchester-City-against-Real-Madrid/):

> “We try to adjust something for the second leg to be a bit more fluid, play with a bit more rhythm.”

And then in the second leg pre-match press conference:

> “I have an idea to do something differently, just to be more fluid in attack.”

Fluidity was restored and their passing flowed like water. It’s tweaks like this that won Manchester City a spot in the Champions League Final.
