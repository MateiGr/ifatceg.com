May 25, 2023 — Inter is a very compact and strong side. Their entire team is composed of rocks. They are a collection of very tough and confident players. Inter controlled the middle of the pitch against Fiorentina to win the Coppa Italia.

If you can control the middle of the pitch, you can beat Inter. If you can't, they have the power to hurt you.  

Fiorentina's first goal came from an opening in the middle. Francesco Acerbi jumped, which caused confusion within Inter's backline. 

Inter is formidable in the air. Almost every outfield player can comfortably win an aerial duel. That's why they tend to favor long balls centrally.

The center-forward, either Edin Dzeko or Romelu Lukaku, will drop, and a center-back simply has to ping them the ball. Direct and effective play because it normally ends in a numerical advantage in the transition to attack.

Figure 3.1 and 3.2 are examples of why controlling the middle of the pitch is vital. 

Inter favors overloading the right, and then they apply speed in the half-spaces with alternating runs. 

First, Federico Dimarco makes a run on the far side, and then Lautaro Martinez on the ball side. Give Marcelo Brozovic or Nicolo Barella enough time and space, and they will pick out the right pass. They both need to be tightly man-marked, no time and space should be afforded to them.

A constant barrage of half-space runs and uncontested long passes allow Inter to get back into the match.

When Inter got the 2-1 lead, they knew how to keep it.

Inter allows space wide and packs the middle out of possession. Their strength in the tackle and aerial duels makes breaking them down a tough task. 

They want you to play out wide because they will win the headers when the ball is crossed in. They are sure of themselves and confident. Every tackle is assertive and accurate.
