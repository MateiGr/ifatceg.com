May 26, 2023 â€” Manchester United were narrow and at times unruly in defending against Chelsea yesterday. Their full-backs kept getting dragged inside, opening up space on the wings.

Chelsea is not a clinical team at the moment, but their passing when transitioning to attack was sublime. They should have scored at least three goals. 

It's not one player's fault; it must be something happening in training because the entire team has lost the ability to shoot accurately.

Narrowness combined with man-to-man marking where players are susceptible to getting pulled out of position is not a good mix. Manchester United would be better suited allowing runs inside while having their full-backs remain in line with the center-backs, not reacting to every movement. 

A clinical team like Manchester City should be able to take advantage of the space Manchester United allowed wide.
