Michael Olise [required surgery](https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/crystal-palace-winger-required-surgery-on-hamstring-injury/) after suffering a grade three tear in his hamstring, and will be out for up to three months. Huge blow for Crystal Palace. Without Wilfried Zaha, they will likely need to buy a winger. There's very little depth.
