In this position, David De Gea has two choices.

1. The safe play would be to thump the ball forward vertically to take no risks and get the ball out of danger. 
2. Play the ball to Wan-Bissaka so that he can then play the ball up the right wing

De Gea instead choices to play the ball to Harry Maguire with his back to the goal.

Erik Lamela smartly blocked off the pass to Wan-Bissaka from Maguire, and the three Sevilla forwards collapsed, won back the ball, then quickly converted for the first goal.
