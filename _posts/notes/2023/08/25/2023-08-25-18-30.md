[Raheem Sterling](https://x.com/thebluedodger/status/1695189034551718092?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g):

"It's a target I had to set myself (being Chelsea's top scorer this season). [...] If I'm 100% at something, I know what I can do and that's what I'm doing this year, just 100% focus on scoring goals and helping my team."

When a player says that, watch out.
