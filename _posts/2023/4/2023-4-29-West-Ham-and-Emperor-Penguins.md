April 29, 2023 — West Ham's defense has a tendency to be too compact, which gives space to attackers on the far-side. There has been a trend of back post goals over several matches with the same compact shape.

They have the numbers to plug the spaces with bodies but they huddle together like a pack of Emperor Penguins seeking warmth.

Here are two examples from their recent matches against Brighton and Arsenal.

Mitoma was smart to move outside then aim his run for the back post, taking advantage of West Ham's narrow defense.

West Ham will play Manchester City, Manchester United, Brentford, Leeds, and Leicester in their final five league matches. 

All of those teams should be looking to sneak one or two forwards into the space behind West Ham's narrow compact defense and attack the back post. If one of those teams doesn’t manage to score a goal on the back post, I’ll be surprised.
