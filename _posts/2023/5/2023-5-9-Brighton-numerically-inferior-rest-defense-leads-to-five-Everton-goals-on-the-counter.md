May 9, 2023 — Brighton leak goals because they don't commit enough players to their rest defense. Everton took advantage of this and scored five goals, all on the counter.

Now Brighton are in panic mode. Lewis Dunk was their last defense, now they have to scramble back, which never ends well. Dunk's out of the play because it'll take too long to recover from stretching for the ball like that.

Doucouré was smart to hold his run and allow Webster to get ahead of him, opening the space behind Webster for the pass.

Brighton only kept two players in their rest defense, committing every other player forward. On occasions, even Webster joined the attack, which left them fully vulnerable if they lost the ball, which they did.

Classic super compact contraction towards the ball in the panic to get back.

Brighton are always the numerical inferior team on the counter. You can't make up for this basic flaw in their system with a qualitative superiority. Any Premier League team should be able to take advantage of this mismatch on the break.

My suggestion would be to switch to any formation that allows them to use a three-at-the-back when in possession, rather than the two-at-the-back they use right now.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brighton are one of the few who could pull off a 3-4-3 diamond. A 3-1 sub-structure would be more secure, outnumbering the press. Use the outside CBs like wingers if needed. Allow Mac Allister to play in the left half-space. Form more triangles, they&#39;ve lacked ideas lately. <a href="https://t.co/zAEFJjsb4Q">pic.twitter.com/zAEFJjsb4Q</a></p>&mdash; Tactics Journal (@TacticsJournal) <a href="https://twitter.com/TacticsJournal/status/1655645340417024020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One of the outside center-backs can venture forward, but they have to ensure that they have at least two players back to maintain a numerical advantage over the opposition's forwards.

In matches where they have the qualitative superiority, as they did against Everton, they often become too comfortable and reckless in attack. For instance, Webster getting too far forward is unnecessary. Unnecessary risks for little to no gain. 

This has become a pattern with Robert De Zerbi's side in his first season with the club. 

- Draw against Leeds
- Loss to Tottenham
- Draw and then loss to Nottingham Forrest
- Loss to Fulham
- Loss and then drew to Leicester
- Loss to Everton

These are struggling teams they are getting beat by. One bad result, you can give them a pass, but a trend like this needs to be investigated further.
