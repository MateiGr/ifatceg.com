September 24, 2023 â€” Matheus Nunes showcases his awareness to cover for Manuel Akanji and intercept a counter, his De Bruyne like qualities attacking the half-space, and then a pinpoint cross into Erling Haaland for this Manchester City goal.

This is the role John Stones normally takes up, responsible for covering for either Manuel Akanji or Kyle Walker when they get forward. Someone has to protect that space to the right of Ruben Dias, or it's an easy counter.

Immediately attacking the space is key. Pass and then move. No one from Nottingham Forest effectively tracks him, so a 3v2 is created with both Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez marked.

Smart from Nunes to let the ball run to Foden so he can continue attacking the space at full speed. Had he taken the ball in stride, Foden's marker would have been able to stick out a leg and stop the play.

Erling Haaland always favors attacking the back-post. That is his default. And Nunes puts this ball exactly where he needed to.

This play perfectly showcased all of Matheus Nunes' qualities. He recognized where the deficiency was, dropped, forced the turnover, immediately attacked the space.
