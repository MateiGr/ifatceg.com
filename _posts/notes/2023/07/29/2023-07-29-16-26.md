According to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/28/premier-league-referees-to-add-on-time-lost-for-goal-celebrations-this-season), in an attempt to "stop time wasting", Premier League matches will now have more extra time similar to that used in the World Cup. The balance was perfect with an in play average of 54mins 49secs last season. We'll now have 8-10+ minutes added on.
