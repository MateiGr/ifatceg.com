2023-3-3-Match-Preview-Man-City-vs-Newcastle-04Mar2023.md

If it were up to me, this is the starting eleven I would pick for both Man City and Newcastle in their match on Saturday, March 4, 2023. Please note that while this lineup is not a prediction, my expectations for how the teams will react and perform in this configuration are.

Pep Guardiola will want to control this match. 

> Pep Guardiola: "When I want runners in attacking midfield, I'd put Phil [Foden], [Ilkay] Gundo. They're better than Kevin [De Bruyne] when it’s more close to the box. When I want more control, I'd play Bernardo [Silva], I'd play another type of player..."
> 
>  “If I want to buildup from left, I’ll always play Laporte, If I want defenders in the box I play Ake and Dias. If I want runners in midfield Foden and Gundo are the best. If my tactics work they say I’m genius, if it doesn’t they say I’m overthinking.” 

Newcastle will look to press high and aggressively when the ball is in Man City's defensive end to force Ederson (GK) to play the ball long. Man City prefers to play short.

I think Man City should elect to go with Bernardo Silva over Kevin De Bruyne in the midfield, as he is more press-resistant with his back to the defender. That ability to receive the ball facing the goal and turn will be important to help work the ball out of Man City's defensive end when they are being pressed in their own defensive end.

Newcastle's lineup is predictable because they don't rotate, so I would be surprised if they alter their usual lineup for such a big game.

Man City has the qualitative superiority, but Newcastle plays better as a unit. They have a deeper understanding of where each player should be and their role because of the simplicity of their structure, and their lineups are more consistent. You can see their chemistry at play when they counter-press.

NEW Counter Press.jpeg

The Newcastle front-three of Allan Saint-Maximin (LW), Callum Wilson (CF), and Miguel Almiron (RW) will be right in the face of Man City, zipping around, trying to force them into errors. Joelinton (CM) will closely mark Bernardo Silva (CM), and Bruno Guimaraes (CM) should also closely mark Rodri (DM). Kieran Trippier (RB) will be pushed forward to help intercept any more direct passes into Gundogan or Foden.

Aymeric Laporte (LCB) and Ruben Dias (RCB) will be on either side of Ederson (GK), with Nathan Ake (LB) closer to the box compared to Kyle Walker (RB), who will be further forward up the right-wing.

Riyad Mahrez (RW) will move into the right half-space to provide more room for Walker (RB) on the right-wing. Ilkay Gundogan (CM) and Bernardo Silva (CM) will drop back to receive a short pass and move the ball out of their own half. If the short pass is not on, Ederson (GK) will pass long to either Walker (RB), Haaland (CF), or Foden (LW).

MCI In Possesion vs Newcastle.jpeg

Once Man City get past the counter-press, Newcastle will settle into a 4-4-2 mid-block with Man City playing in a lopsided 4-3-3, with Walker (RB) pushing higher and Ake (LB) tucking in to form a back three at times. Bernardo Silva (CM) might be on the left-hand side in the left half-space, but based on past performances, it's expected he will play in the right half-space.

Rodri (DM) will play as the single pivot, and Silva (CM) will assist in the build-up if Newcastle press higher to maintain a numerical advantage in midfield. Foden (LW) will stay on the touch-line, while Mahrez (RW) will move inside to provide Walker (RB) with more space on the right-wing. Silva (CM), Mahrez (RW), and Walker (RB) will form a triangle on the right-wing and try to work the ball into the corner. They'll look to switch the play to Foden (LW), or play Gundogan (CM) or Haaland (CF) behind Newcastle's backline. 

A similar triangle could form to overload the left-wing with Foden (LW), Gundogan (CM), and Ake (LB) to switch the ball to Mahrez (RW) or play Haaland (CF) in.

MCI Counter Press vs NEW.jpeg

For Man City's counter-press, they'll mark man-to-man and position themselves to force Newcastle into the wide areas, preferably herding them into Newcastle's left-wing, while still maintaining the correct structure to deal with long balls to Newcastle's forwards. The trigger for the counter-press will come when Newcastle plays the ball out wide.

Counterpress MCI vs NEW.jpeg

Man City will look to squeeze Newcastle in the corner and force them to play the ball long or make an error. The highest quality chances will come from these turnovers as Man City will quickly work the ball into the box. The quicker Newcastle can advance the ball into the middle third, the better, to escape the press and attempt to outnumber the remaining Man City defenders behind their press.

RW NEW v MCI.jpeg

Newcastle prefer to target the right-wing with the triangle between Kieren Trippier (RB), Miguel Almirion (RW), and Sean Longstaff (CM). It would be smart for Man City to use a shut-down defender like Nathan Ake at left-back to prevent any attempts to advance the ball to the corner or inside the box.

RW 2 NEW v MCI.jpeg

Once the ball is played into Almiron (RW), Trippier will overlap, and Longstaff (CM) will provide an outlet to one-two and play Almiron to the corner. Wilson (CF) will make a run to either the middle or near post close to goal, and Saint-Maximin (LW) and Joelinton (CM) will both sit at the top of the box. The crosser of the ball normally will aim their pass to the top of the box. 

There are many examples of this type of move from different Newcastle matches, one such example came in their game versus Southampton on January 24th.

Guimaraes (CM) comes over to aid in the overload, making it a 4v3. Trippier plays the ball to Almiron, Almiron to Longstaff, then Longstaff plays Almiron to the corner for the cross.

Tactical Previews/Untitled.jpeg

Both Joelinton (LW) and in this case, Willock (CM), are free at the top of the box for a high-quality shot that they did not score. That is one of the main ways they create high-quality chances.

Another way they'll look to create chances is through forcing turnovers in the middle third, when Man City is most vulnerable because Man City tends to spread quite wide when they're transitioning from their defensive third to the other team's half.

This example from the Aston Villa match on Feb 12th showcases how Man City can be vulnerable and disorganized at times when they turn over the ball in the middle third. Man City were in a lopsided 3-2 structure in this next example, whereas I'm suggesting they will play against Newcastle in a 4-1 structure.

Tactical Previews/Untitled 2.jpeg

Silva (CM) lost the ball to Luiz, and Akanji was caught out too wide rather than centrally where he should have been, leaving Watkins free in an acre of space. He was played in by Luiz, and Watkins dribbled past Akanji to score. This is the type of chance Newcastle will attempt to recreate.

One bonus thing to watch for is the battle between Kyle Walker (RB) and Allan Saint-Maximin (LW). The reason why I would want Silva (CM) on the right hand side is to help Walker deal with Saint-Maximin. He had a lot of joy in both team's first head-to-head on August 21, 2022.  

This match should be fairly even, and it is an early kickoff match on Saturday, so has the potential to be cagey. Man City sits second in the league table, just two points behind Arsenal. Newcastle is 5th, trying to claw their way back into the top four with two games in hand, only 4 points separating them and Tottenham. Newcastle is also trying to bounce back from their loss to Man United in the Carabao Cup Final on the weekend.
