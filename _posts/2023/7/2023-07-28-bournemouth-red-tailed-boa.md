Dominic Solanke curving his press is akin to a red-tailed boa constricting upon its prey. There are no places for Shea Charles to turn. He must kick it long, which is the smart option, or attempt the risky pass.

He attempts the risky pass, and Southampton pay.

Philip Billing and Dango Ouattara patrol on the edges with Ryan Christie central in the pocket of space. If Christie's shot gets blocked, those two are there to shoot from range.
