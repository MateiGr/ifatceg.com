August 3, 2023 â€” I was disappointed in the disorganization of Burnley's back-line. They sat too deep, creating space in front of their back-line and overcommitted to the ball carrier, gifting Tottenham easy goals.

Son Heung-min plants on his right foot and launches at the right time to bait Dara O'Shea, creating the separation needed to bring the ball down once it is played over the top.

If O'Shea sticks with Son and Dakhil sticks with Solomon, I don't think they'd get into the box. But both overcommit to the ball carrier leaving the far-side man free.

They are leaving one man free and chasing the ball, which overcomplicates what should be a simple defensive play. They made Tottenham look good, and Tottenham don't need help looking good.

Son Hueng-min recognized the Burnley defenders overcommitting to the ball, so he held his run, opening up the massive space on the far side.

Goalkeeper James Trafford should be urging Burnley to push out at this point because James Maddison should never be this free centrally.

A chance from a turnover in your own end will always lead to a high-quality chance, but any Premier League-level player should be able to score when given this much space.

Burnley created issues for themselves by pushing their back-line too deep, creating space in front of their back-line. Tottenham can easily take advantage of that space between the back-line and the second line.

Burnley should look to use a higher line to shorten the amount of space between their back-line and the second line to limit the possibility for chances like this.
