July 31, 2023 â€” Pau Torres slotted in at left center-back, with Tyrone Mings central, Eric Konsa on the right, and Matty Cash pushed forward up the right-wing in possession for Aston Villa. A back-three.

I was wondering how they'd use both Tyrone Mings and new signing Pau Torres.

Torres can't sit on the bench, he's too good, but he's left-footed. Mings is left-footed. Konsa seems to be undroppable, playing at right center-back and right-back during these preseason friendlies. The answer is a back-three. 

Konsa and Torres act as the ball-playing center-backs, ready and able to get forward or push infield. Both are fantastic passers. Mings is the statue, the rock. It's a well-balanced back-line in possession, and very tall.

This allows Matty Cash to sit higher up the wing at all times, waiting for the chance to cross.

Aston Villa had a lot of success attacking the right-wing last season with Ashley Young, and we should expect more of the same this season with Cash.

Once Aston Villa loses possession, they switch back to a flat-back four, with Matty Cash coming back to right-back.

A feature of Unai Emery's side is the high line, attempted offside trap. I could see someone like Nicolas Jackson of Chelsea or Rasmus Hojlund of Manchester United having a lot of fun running into the channels behind Villa's back-line this season.

When building up from the back, Aston Villa use this 4-2 sub-structure, with Pau Torres at left-back. 

This is their baseline. The new shape that Aston Villa deployed against Brentford to include Pau Torres. This is the back-line I'd expect to see on game-week 1.
