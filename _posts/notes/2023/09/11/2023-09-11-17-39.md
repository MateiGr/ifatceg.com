Anwar El Ghazi played for Ajax until 2017, when he was sold to Lille, [due to falling out with then manager Peter Bosz](https://www.besoccer.com/new/el-ghazi-leaves-ajax-for-lille). Ajax lost to Manchester United in the Europa League final, Bosz left, and Ten Hag was hired in 2017. Now [reports say United want to sign him](https://x.com/deadlinedaylive/status/1701330722085044734?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g). Full circle.
