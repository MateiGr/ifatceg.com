I mentioned in April that ["I felt no emotion"](https://twitter.com/tacticsjournal/status/1659906175658278915?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g) when I watched Tottenham. Ange Postecoglou brings that emotion back. He revives the soul of the club and should elevate those who have been underperforming, like Heung-min Son.
