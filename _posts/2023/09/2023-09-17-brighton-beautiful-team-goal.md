September 17, 2023 â€” Brighton scored one of the cleanest team goals I've seen in the past year against Manchester United.

Brilliant from van Hecke to pick out this pass to Danny Welbeck, who has dropped back from his center-forward position, a move Welbeck often likes to make.

Smart from Joel Veltman to pass to Danny Welbeck instead of Simon Adingra. Most would make the pass to Adingra but the pass to Welbeck pins Lisandro Martinez, opening space for Adingra wide.

This is when you know this is direct from the training ground. Remarkable awareness from Adam Lallana to dummy the ball. 

Unsure why Casemiro doesn't pick up Danny Welbeck, as he's completely free. The only man unmarked, it should be Casemiro's responsibility to follow the center-forward when they drop if a center-back doesn't pick them up.

Nothing Andre Onana can do to stop that shot.
