The main point from the video being how they plan a warm-up based on the next game. 

> "If our next rival will park the bus and we won't have spaces, he doesn't see the point of doing certain exercises in the warm-up on those days. Even in that detail is Pep Guardiola. He's involving all of us in the next game, that is teamwork.
> 
> I have to ask Carlos, Pep's assistant, how Leverkusen defends, what we will find ourselves in the next game. Are we going to have to make passes and movements to spaces? Ok, so in the warm-up of those days, we will do movement exercises to the spaces." 

It's not only the rotation within the lineups game to game, it's the little details like this that allow the team to properly recover.
