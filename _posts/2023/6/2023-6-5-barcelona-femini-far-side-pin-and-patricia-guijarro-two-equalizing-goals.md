June 5, 2023 — Barcelona Feminí utilized a simple, repeatable pattern on the right-wing, with Patricia Guijarro targeting her runs into the space in front of Wolfsburg's back-line, helping them recover from a 2-0 deficit in the Women's Champions League Final.

Barcelona had their three forwards run Wolfsburg deep to further open up the space in front of their back-line.

Wolfsburg is deep and pinned. The two defenders in front of Patricia Guijarro are stuck ball-watching, attempting to block off the passing lane from Caroline Hansen. Guijarro is passed the ball and slots it home for the goal. 

That's the first goal to bring the match back to 2-1. The same thing happens for Barcelona's next goal, the equalizing goal.

Again, Wolfsburg doesn't do a good job tracking Patricia Guijarro into the box, and her marker is caught ball-watching.

Attack the right-wing, pin the far-side, and then have a free woman to pass to in the middle of the box, unmarked. Three goals.
