If it were up to me, this is the starting eleven I'd pick for both Liverpool and Manchester United for their match on Sunday, March 5, 2023.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CD081601-6273-4467-862E-9DB481189025.jpeg)

Since this is a derby at Anfield, when Man United is in possession, you'd expect Liverpool to press relentlessly. However, there's a chance they'll sit back and defend in a narrow 4-4-2 out of possession.

Man United should look to take advantage of Liverpool's narrowness by overloading either wing, specifically the left-wing. That's why I'd like to see Jadon Sancho at left-wing because the overload he and center-forward Marcus Rashford create should overwhelm Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back. Luke Shaw and Fred will both help in that overload, with Shaw being the safe pass out as the free man.

Bruno Fernandes would shift forward into the space that Rashford occupied, and Antony at right-wing would lurk behind left-back Andrew Robertson.

I'll get to this when I talk about Man United's out-of-possession shape, but I would have to assume that Fred will likely operate in the left half-space, aiding in the overload on the left-wing and staying further forward to get onto the end of balls on the edge of the box.

The key for Man United will be to overload the left-wing and then switch the play to the right-wing, so they can isolate Robertson 1v1 and put crosses into the box from right-back Diego Dalot or Antony at right-wing.

If Liverpool can press Man United man-to-man high and hard, they'll have a more difficult time playing through the wings. It will still be a game won out wide because that will be the path of least resistance for Man United.

When counter-pressing, Liverpool should look to press hard to pin Man United back into their own defensive end and force them to play the ball direct in the air rather than on the ground.

When Liverpool is in possession, I'd expect them to be pressed aggressively by Man United, not allowing them any time or space on the ball. Fernandes will look to curve his run and be the head of the press when the ball is with Liverpool's backline. Fred is a key figure for Man United because he will, as Erik Ten Hag likes to say, be playing the part of a "mosquito."

Erik Ten Hag on Fred vs. Barcelona on February 23rd: "His role was to stop Frenkie de Jong and be like a mosquito all over him."

Fred is used to shadow the other team's most important transition playmaker, in either half-space because he's reliable in the tackle. He did the same with De Bruyne versus Man City and Longstaff, or Joelinton when Longstaff was subbed out, versus Newcastle. Fred will look to disrupt Henderson’s ability to play the ball into the triangle on the right-wing, between Henderson, right-wing Mohamed Salah and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.

The front four of Man United pressing should cause Liverpool problems advancing the ball into the wide areas. They will try to force center-backs Virgil Van Dijk and Joel Matip in to mistakes to spring counter attacks.

Darwin Nunez, or whoever plays at left-wing, will likely invert to allow more room for Robertson on the left-wing, by dragging Dalot infield. This is where Antony’s ability to cover larger areas in defense comes in to play, he excels at pressing, taking pressure off the other midfielders and Dalot. His presence should help disrupt Robertson on the left-wing.

If Sancho at left-wing gets caught further out wide marking Alexander-Arnold, Matip should look to advance the ball into the right-wing to help overload Man United 4v3. Matip has been known to do this in the past to great effect.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/C4BEC60F-B70A-47FE-8E62-0FB483925635.jpeg) 

Liverpool should be counter-pressed high by Man United with forwards Fernandes and Rashford curving their runs and Antony and Sancho man-to-man out wide. Fred will tight to Henderson, as he is the most important player for Liverpool in transition, but he should get further forward to mark whoever sits in-front of the back line. In this case, defensive-midfielder Keita.
