This is a clash of two resolute defenses that offer little threat going forward due to most of their threats being out with injury. On paper, you'd expect neither team to score. The title of this post matches the blandness of this match.

Tyrick Mitchel, Marc Guehi, and Joachim Andersen are all superb for Crystal Palace but they are missing Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise, and Jefferson Lerma. 

Willy Boly and Serge Aurier are great for Nottingham Forest, but they are missing Taiwo Awoniyi. Murillo is a terrific addition with his poise, quickness, and passing ability. 

Steve Cooper on a mazing run Murillo made in the 1st half: 

> "Everyone has asked me about it. What he did to get there was spectacular. I felt his passing, composure was exceptional. He's making a lot of tackles, interceptions. He's a real talent. We've enjoyed working with him. He's trained excellently."

Nottingham Forest had a ton of trouble, in past matches and in the first half, building up through their right with Boly, Aurier, and anyone who comes to help. They need to work it back and forth from side-to-side, like they did towards the end of the 2nd half, more often, to open up room for midfielders Orel Mangala and Ibrahim Sangar√©. 

If you want to stop Nottingham Forest, force them to play through their right, trap them, and then allow Boly to pass out from the back. Don't allow Murillo to have a lot of time on the ball because he knows how to pick out a pass.
