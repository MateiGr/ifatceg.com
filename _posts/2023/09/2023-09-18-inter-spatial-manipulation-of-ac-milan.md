September 18, 2023 â€” Inter masterfully exploited space by manipulating it, capitalizing on AC Milan's disjointed man-marking.

There is one word to describe Marcus Thuram: "Tank."

He collided with Malick Thiaw as if Thiaw owed him money. Thuram's strength and speed made Thiaw's 1v1 marking a costly mistake.

The overload created by AC Milan on the far side left a substantial gap for Denzel Dumfries to exploit. Thuram ignored Dumfries' run, highlighting a potential vulnerability for future opponents.

Crossing as close to the touch-line as you can is a solid strategy since AC Milan commits all their men to the penalty area regardless of how many men are free at the top of the box. All of them are ball watching, leaving space free at the top of the box.

Two AC Milan players jumped, allowing Dimarco to receive the pass. However, notice the man-marking on the far side, leaving three players marked and one defender free at the end.

When two players delay their runs, forcing their markers to stand still, they create space behind the back-line. The closest Inter forward then enters the box, pulling their marker with them and gaining free access to the space behind the back-line.

AC Milan, trailing 1-0, began to push men forward, leaving only two in the rest defense. When the ball was turned over, it resulted in favorable 3v2 or 2v2 counter-attacking situations.

The two AC Milan forwards manipulated space effectively by making runs into the box, thus creating space behind them.

Inter had AC Milan chasing shadows. Delaying runs or attacking space to pull defenders is the key to unlocking AC Milan, as their defenders are focused on their assigned marks. If too many defenders commit to a single mark, opportunities arise on the far side.
