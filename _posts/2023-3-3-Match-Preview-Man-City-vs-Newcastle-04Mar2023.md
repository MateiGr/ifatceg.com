This should be a fairly even match, and it is an early kickoff on Saturday, so it has the potential to be cagey. While Man City's lineup is not predictable, Newcastle's lineup is predictable because they don't rotate, so I would be surprised if they alter their usual lineup for such a big game.  

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/46DE27A3-9FE1-433E-A2DD-5CE3CC943795.jpeg)

This is the starting eleven I would pick for both Man City and Newcastle in their match on Saturday, March 4, 2023. My expectations for how the teams will react and perform in this configuration are a prediction based on past performances and both manager's words in interviews or press conferences. 

> Eddie Howe, Newcastle manager, on their approach playing Man City: "I said there's many ways to approach the game. And I wouldn't criticise anyone who does that [park the bus] because that might be their best way of getting a result. I'm not sure it's ours." 

Newcastle will look to press high and aggressively when the ball is in Man City's defensive end to force Ederson (GK) to play the ball long. Man City prefers to play short and will defend by attempting to control possession. 

> Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager: "When I want runners in attacking midfield, I'd put Phil [Foden], [Ilkay] Gundo. They're better than Kevin [De Bruyne] when it’s more close to the box. When I want more control, I'd play Bernardo [Silva], I'd play another type of player..."

> Pep Guardiola: “If I want to buildup from left, I’ll always play Laporte, If I want defenders in the box I play Ake and Dias. If I want runners in midfield Foden and Gundo are the best. If my tactics work they say I’m genius, if it doesn’t they say I’m overthinking.” 

Pep Guardiola will want to control this match, but I think Kevin De Bruyne will get the start in right center-midfield, to help find the run of Haaland and rotate on the right-wing with Phil Foden (RW). 

Foden gets the nod ahead of Riyad Mahrez on the right-wing for three reasons. 

1. He has been performing well the past two matches, with three goals and two assist, Pep will want likely want to keep that rhythm going. 
2. He has a higher defensive work-rate and is better in the tackle, which will be important out of possession when helping mark either Joelinton (LCM) or Saint-Maximin (LW). 
3. Newcastle like to sit deep at times, when out of possession, and as a “runner” he will be more effective in tight spaces out wide against Dan Burn (LB), who is lanky and a good tackler, or in the right half-space when he rotates with De Bruyne (RCM). 

Jack Grealish (LW) was rested midweek, and only played 72 minutes on the weekend, in Man City's 4-1 win over Bournemouth. 

> Pep Guardiola: "If I need for example, build-up from left-back is most important, then Aymeric Laporte is going to play every game. But sometimes I need a defender, defender, defender in the box, and [Nathan] Ake and Ruben [Dias] are the best..."

Ruben Dias (RCB) and Kyle Walker (RB) are in the lineup to stop Allan Saint-Maximin (LW). The speedy and agile left-winger will try to dribble past the equally quick Kyle Walker, to get inside the box. Saint-Maximin had a lot of success in their first head-to-head on August 21, 2022, Man City should look to neutralize him without sacrificing the effectiveness of the press from Aymeric Laporte (LCB) and Nathan Ake (LB) on Newcastle's right-wing. 

Man City has the qualitative superiority, but Newcastle plays better as a unit. They have a deeper understanding of where each player should be and their role because of the simplicity of their structure, and their lineups are more consistent. You can see their chemistry at play when they counter-press.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/21E9DFA8-719A-4FA1-B81D-D2927BB03881.jpeg)

The Newcastle front-three of Allan Saint-Maximin (LW), Callum Wilson (CF), and Miguel Almiron (RW) will be right in the face of Man City, zipping around, trying to force them into errors. Joelinton (LCM) will closely mark De Bruyne (RCM), and Bruno Guimaraes (CM) should also closely mark Rodri (DM). Kieran Trippier (RB) will be pushed forward to help intercept any direct passes into Gundogan (LCM) or Grealish (RW).

Aymeric Laporte (LCB) and Ruben Dias (RCB) will be on either side of Ederson (GK), with Nathan Ake (LB) closer to the box compared to Kyle Walker (RB), who will be further forward up the right-wing.

Phil Foden (RW) will move into the right half-space to provide more room for Walker (RB) on the right-wing, then drop back with Ilkay Gundogan (LCM) to receive a short pass and move the ball out of their own half. Kevin De Bruyne (RCM) will either drop back to help or stay further forward with Haaland (CF). If the short pass is not on, Ederson (GK) will pass long to either Walker (RB), De Bruyne (RCM), Haaland (CF), or Grealish (LW).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/868AD575-F267-4439-AE33-07928A056461.jpeg)

Once Man City get past the counter-press, Newcastle will settle into a 4-4-2 mid or low block with Man City playing in a lopsided 4-3-3. Walker (RB) will push higher and Ake (LB) will tuck in to form a back three at times. 

Rodri (DM) will play as the single pivot, and Gundogan (LCM) will assist in the build-up if Newcastle press higher, to maintain a numerical advantage versus Newcastle's inital press of Saint-Maximin (LW) and Wilson (CF). Grealish (LW) will stay on the touch-line, while Foden (RW) inverting into the right half-space to provide Walker (RB) with more space on the right-wing. Also, in the past few matches there's been an effort made to give the left-winger, either Jack Grealish or Phil Foden, more freedom to move around the field, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see Grealish (LW) move infield when he receives the ball.

De Bruyne (RCM), Foden (RW), and Walker (RB) will form a triangle on the right-wing and try to work the ball into the corner. The goal being to switch create a high quality chance for Grealish (LW) on the back post, or play Gundogan (LCM) or Haaland (CF) behind Newcastle's backline. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/25CB8BB2-1541-4D0B-A839-940AB963701A.jpeg)

A similar triangle could form to overload the left-wing with Grealish (LW), Gundogan (LCM), and Ake (LB) to switch the ball to Foden (RW) or play Haaland (CF) in.

One such example of this came this week in Man City's FA Cup match versus Bristol City on February, 28, 2023. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/B9253578-A67C-4CE3-93E1-F28787F90866.jpeg)

Man City overloaded the left-wing and Nathan Ake (LB) switched the ball to Mahrez (RW), who was in space. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/F621E889-35B5-4AAF-AF22-B7B6327D6AF7.jpeg)


![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/E0C64127-D1D3-4BAB-8C4D-DDEB64FBE81F.jpeg)

Kevin De Bruyne (RCM) then checked his run to Mahrez (RW) for a one-two, which dragged both defenders out, opening the space to play Mahrez into the box. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/0C19A4A6-A62A-4A18-A4EE-CF3FB17DC340.jpeg)

Mahrez (RW) then played the perfect pass to the back post for Foden (LW) to tap in. Man City will look to recreate chances like this versus Newcastle, with Newcastle's back post on Man City's left-wing being the most vulnerable because Trippier (RB) likes to get higher up the pitch. There should be space open on the right side of Newcastle's box, like there was versus Bristol City.

MCI Counter Press vs NEW.jpeg

For Man City's counter-press, they'll mark man-to-man and position themselves to force Newcastle into the wide areas, preferably herding them into Newcastle's left-wing, while still maintaining the correct structure to deal with long balls to Newcastle's forwards. The trigger for the counter-press will come when Newcastle plays the ball out wide.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/3A263C93-3BEB-4FF9-88C0-210FD8422FDD.jpeg)

Man City will look to squeeze Newcastle in the corner and force them to play the ball long or make an error. The highest quality chances will come from these turnovers as Man City will quickly work the ball into the box. The quicker Newcastle can advance the ball into the middle third, the better, to avoid the press and attempt to outnumber the remaining Man City defenders behind their press. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/E650AA45-5605-49B5-9DAD-5C73DE7EA384.jpeg)

Newcastle prefer to target the right-wing with the triangle between Kieren Trippier (RB), Miguel Almirion (RW), and Sean Longstaff (RCM). It would be smart for Man City to use a shut-down defender like Nathan Ake (LB) to prevent any attempts to advance the ball to the corner or inside the box. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/6F50AD86-A9AB-4B8D-8ED7-6B5E427985E7.jpeg)

Once the ball is played into Almiron (RW), Trippier will overlap, and Longstaff (RCM) will provide an outlet to one-two and play Almiron to the corner. Wilson (CF) will make a run to either the middle or near post close to goal, and Saint-Maximin (LW) and Joelinton (LCM) will both sit at the top of the box. The crosser of the ball normally will aim their pass to the top of the box. 

There are many examples of this type of move from different Newcastle matches, one such example came in their game versus Southampton on January 24th.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/9208E6A6-4BD8-4258-ADD9-2452BC12462D.jpeg)

Guimaraes (CM) comes over to aid in the overload, making it a 4v3. Trippier plays the ball to Almiron, Almiron to Longstaff, then Longstaff plays Almiron to the corner for the cross.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/6BD4D769-1F95-415B-B974-C82C18664A9C.jpeg)

Both Joelinton (LW) and in this case, Willock (LCM), are free at the top of the box for a high-quality shot that they did not score. That is one of the main ways they create high-quality chances.

Another way they'll look to create chances is through forcing turnovers in the middle third, when Man City is most vulnerable because Man City tends to spread quite wide when they're transitioning from their defensive third to the other team's half.

This example from the Aston Villa match on Feb 12th showcases how Man City can be vulnerable and disorganized at times when they turn over the ball in the middle third. Man City were in a lopsided 3-2 structure, whereas I'm suggesting they will play against Newcastle in a 4-1 structure. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/F7B1D0FC-8D14-45A6-9A29-3BC736ECC968.jpeg)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/8B8B7AF8-1AE7-421E-9ECD-9177501A24EF.jpeg)

Silva (CM) lost the ball to Luiz, and Akanji was caught out too wide rather than centrally where he should have been, leaving Watkins free in an acre of space. He was played in by Luiz, and Watkins dribbled past Akanji to score. This is the type of chance Newcastle will attempt to recreate. 

Man City are second in the league table, just two points behind Arsenal. Newcastle are 5th, trying to claw their way back into the top four with two games in hand, only 4 points separating them and Tottenham. Newcastle are also trying to bounce back from their loss to Man United in the Carabao Cup Final on the weekend.
